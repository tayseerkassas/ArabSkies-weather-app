ArabSkies" simple weather app

**ArabSkies** is a cross-platform weather application built using **Flutter**, designed specifically to serve users across the **Arab world**. It delivers real-time weather data for **over 100 major cities** across the Middle East and North Africa, including capitals and key regional hubs in Syria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, UAE, Morocco, Tunisia, and more.

The app integrates the **OpenWeather API** to fetch accurate and up-to-date weather conditions, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and weather forecasts. Users can select their city from an extensive dropdown list and instantly view detailed weather information with appealing visual icons and a responsive layout.

In addition to its weather functionality, ArabSkies features a user **authentication system using Firebase Auth**, allowing secure registration and login experiences. The app’s UI is designed with usability in mind, offering a smooth, clean, and visually engaging experience. The application also uses **GetX** for state management and navigation .

This project highlights my skills in:

* Building production-grade Flutter applications
* Integrating RESTful APIs (OpenWeather)
* Implementing authentication via Firebase
* UI/UX design with responsiveness
* Managing state using GetX
